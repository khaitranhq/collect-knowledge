### 3️⃣ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

> **Enhances reasoning through step-by-step logical processes, breaking complex problems into manageable sequential steps**

#### 💡 Zero-Shot CoT Example

```markdown
Problem: A company starts with 1,200 employees. In January, they hire 15% more staff. In February, they lay off 8% of their total workforce. In March, they hire 50 new employees. How many employees do they have at the end of March?

Let's think step by step:
```

#### 💡 Few-Shot CoT Example

```markdown
Problem: If a pizza is cut into 8 equal slices and 3 people want to share it equally, how many slices does each person get?

Solution: Let's think step by step:
Step 1: Total slices available = 8 slices
Step 2: Number of people sharing = 3 people  
Step 3: Divide total slices by number of people: 8 ÷ 3 = 2.67 slices
Step 4: Since we can't have partial slices in practice, each person gets 2 slices with 2 slices remaining
Therefore, each person gets 2 slices, with 2 slices left over.

Problem: A train travels 150 miles in the first 2 hours, then 120 miles in the next 1.5 hours. What is the train's average speed for the entire journey?

Solution: Let's think step by step:

## 💡 Pro Tips

### ✨ Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Begin with Zero-Shot, upgrade as needed
- **Measure Everything**: Track accuracy, cost, and latency
- **Test Thoroughly**: Use representative datasets for evaluation
- **Document Decisions**: Record why specific frameworks were chosen
- **Monitor Performance**: Set up ongoing evaluation metrics

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

- **Over-Engineering**: Using complex frameworks for simple tasks
- **Poor Examples**: Few-shot examples that don't represent real data
- **Ignoring Costs**: Not considering computational expenses
- **Format Lock-in**: Committing to single format without testing alternatives
- **Missing Edge Cases**: Not testing framework robustness

### 🔧 Implementation Tips

- **Gradual Rollout**: Test frameworks on subsets before full deployment
- **A/B Testing**: Compare frameworks side-by-side with real traffic
- **Fallback Strategy**: Have simpler frameworks as backups
- **Version Control**: Track prompt evolution and performance changes
- **Team Training**: Ensure team understands chosen framework rationale

## 🎓 Conclusion

The effectiveness of each framework depends on your specific use case, available resources, and performance requirements. Start with foundational approaches and progressively move to more sophisticated techniques as your needs evolve.

**Remember**: The best framework is the simplest one that meets your requirements. Optimization without clear metrics and business justification often leads to unnecessary complexity.
