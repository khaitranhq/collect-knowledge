# AI Agent Overview

## Core Pillars of AI Interaction

### 1. Prompt Engineering

- The way we communicate with AI models
- Crucial for getting accurate and desired responses
- Forms the foundation of AI interaction

### 2. Context Management

- Provides necessary background information
- Helps AI understand the scope and requirements
- Ensures relevant and accurate responses

### 3. Model Selection

- Choosing the appropriate AI model for specific tasks
- Considering model capabilities and limitations
- Matching model strengths with task requirements

## Prompt Writing Strategies

### Low-Level Approach (Detailed Specification)

1. **Objectives**

   - Clear statement of goals
   - Expected outcomes
   - Success criteria

2. **Context**

   - Background information
   - Relevant constraints
   - Technical requirements

3. **Detailed Tasks**
   - Step-by-step breakdown
   - Specific requirements
   - Acceptance criteria

### High-Level Approach

- Direct prompt writing
- Suitable for simpler tasks
- Requires expertise in prompt engineering

## Best Practices

### Validation and Quality Control

- Always verify AI-generated outputs
- Test results against requirements
- Implement error checking mechanisms

### Technical Specifications

- Include specific technology versions
- Provide relevant documentation
- Reference agent capabilities and limitations

### Planning and Implementation

- Draft detailed plans before execution
- Break down complex tasks
- Review and iterate solutions

### AI Limitations Awareness

- Recognize that AI may not acknowledge its limitations
- Use the key prompt: "If you don't know or it's out of your scope, admit and say no"
- Regularly validate AI responses
