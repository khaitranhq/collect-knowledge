# Checking object integrity with additional checkums

Amazon S3 uses checksum values to verify the integrity of data that you upload to or download from Amazon S3. In addition, you can request that another checksum value be calculated for any object that you store in Amazon S3. You can select from one of several checksum algorithms to use when uploading or copying your data

## Using supported checksum algorithms

You can select one of the following Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA) or Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) data-integrity check algorithms:

- 🌀 CRC-32
- 🌀 CRC-32C
- 🔒 SHA-1
- 🔒 SHA-256

You can use Console, SDKs, Rest API or CLI to put objects with checksum or retrieve checksum for verification.

## Using Content-MD5 when uploading objects 📦

See `content-md5` option in `aws s3api put-object`

## Using Content-MD5 and the ETag to verify uploaded objects 🔍

The ETag (Entity Tag) for an object in Amazon S3 represents a unique identifier for a specific version of that object, reflecting changes in the object's content but not its metadata. Here's how the ETag is generated based on different scenarios:

- **Plaintext or SSE-S3 Encrypted Objects**: When objects are created using PutObject, PostObject, CopyObject, or through the AWS Management Console, and are either plaintext or encrypted using server-side encryption with S3-managed keys (SSE-S3), the ETag is typically an MD5 digest of the object's data.

- **SSE-C or SSE-KMS Encrypted Objects**: If objects are encrypted using customer-provided keys (SSE-C) or AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS), the ETag is not an MD5 digest.

- **Multipart Uploads and UploadPartCopy**: For objects created via multipart uploads or the UploadPartCopy operation, the ETag is also not an MD5 digest. This applies even if encryption is used or if the object is larger than 16 MB and uploaded via the AWS Management Console as a multipart upload.

If the ETag is an MD5 digest, you can compare it with a calculated or stored Content-MD5 value to verify data integrity.

## Using trailing checksums 🧩

When uploading objects to S3, you can provide a precalculated checksum or let the AWS SDK automatically generate a trailing checksum using a specified algorithm. By setting the ChecksumAlgorithm parameter, the SDK calculates and appends the checksum during upload, allowing S3 to handle verification and upload in a single step.

## Using part-level checksums for multipart uploads 🗂️

When objects are uploaded to Amazon S3, they can be uploaded as a single object or through multipart uploads, with objects larger than 16 MB automatically using multipart upload via the console. In a multipart upload, the ETag is not an MD5 digest of the entire object but is derived from the MD5 digests of each part. Amazon S3 concatenates these MD5 digests, calculates a final digest, and appends the number of parts to the ETag.
