## CloudFront with S3 SSE-KMS

### OAC

- OAC supports SSE-KMS natively (as requests are signed with Sigv4)
- Add a statement to the KMS Key Policy to authorize the OAC

### OAI

- OAI doesnâ€™t support SSE-KMS natively (only SSE-S3)
- Use Lambda@Edge to sign requests from CloudFront to S3
- Make sure to disable OAI for this to work
