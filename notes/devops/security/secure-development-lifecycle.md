# Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)

The Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) integrates security practices into every phase of software development to reduce vulnerabilities and improve resilience.

## Key Phases

1. **Requirements:** Define security and compliance needs early.
2. **Design:** Threat modeling and design reviews identify risks.
3. **Implementation:** Use secure coding standards and automated tools.
4. **Verification:** Perform code reviews, automated testing, and security assessments.
5. **Release:** Security sign-off and documentation of open/closed issues.
6. **Maintenance/Response:** Patch, monitor, and respond to new threats.

## Benefit

- Reduces vulnerabilities and remediation costs
- Improves compliance and stakeholder trust

**Example:**

- Encrypt user data at rest (requirement), design with encryption, implement with standard libraries, test encryption, and patch vulnerabilities post-release.
