# Sidecar Design Pattern

**Reference:** [Microsoft Azure Architecture Center - Sidecar Pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar)

## Overview

The Sidecar pattern involves deploying components of an application into a separate process or container to provide isolation and encapsulation. This pattern enables applications to be composed of heterogeneous components and technologies.

**Etymology:** Named "Sidecar" because it resembles a sidecar attached to a motorcycle. The sidecar is attached to a parent application and provides supporting features, sharing the same lifecycle as the parent application (created and retired together).

**Alternative Names:**

- Sidekick pattern
- Decomposition pattern

## Context and Problem

### Common Requirements

Applications and services often need related functionality such as:

- Monitoring
- Logging
- Configuration management
- Networking services

### Integration Challenges

**Tight Integration Approach:**

- ✅ Efficient use of shared resources (same process)
- ❌ Poor isolation - component outages affect entire application
- ❌ Must use same language as parent application
- ❌ Close interdependence between component and application

**Separate Services Approach:**

- ✅ Flexibility in languages and technologies
- ❌ Each component has own dependencies
- ❌ Requires language-specific libraries for platform access
- ❌ Additional latency from service calls
- ❌ Complex code and dependency management
- ❌ Complicated hosting, deployment, and management

## Solution

**Core Concept:** Co-locate a cohesive set of tasks with the primary application, but place them inside their own process or container, providing a homogeneous interface for platform services across languages.

### Key Characteristics

- **Independence:** Sidecar isn't necessarily part of the application but is connected to it
- **Deployment:** Goes wherever the parent application goes
- **Lifecycle:** Shares the fate of its parent application
- **Scaling:** For each application instance, a sidecar instance is deployed alongside it

### Advantages

1. **Language Independence**

   - Independent from primary application in runtime environment and programming language
   - No need to develop one sidecar per language

2. **Resource Access**

   - Can access the same resources as the primary application
   - Can monitor system resources used by both sidecar and primary application

3. **Low Latency**

   - Proximity to primary application ensures no significant communication latency

4. **Extensibility**
   - Can extend functionality even for applications without native extensibility mechanisms
   - Attaches as own process in same host or sub-container

### Common Implementation

- Often used with containers
- Referred to as "sidecar container" or "sidekick container"

## Issues and Considerations

### Design Considerations

1. **Deployment Format**

   - Consider packaging format for services, processes, or containers
   - Containers are particularly well-suited to the sidecar pattern

2. **Inter-Process Communication**

   - Carefully decide on communication mechanism
   - Use language/framework-agnostic technologies unless performance requires otherwise

3. **Architecture Decisions**

   - Evaluate if functionality would work better as:
     - Separate service
     - Traditional daemon
     - Library implementation
     - Traditional extension mechanism

4. **Integration Depth**
   - Language-specific libraries may provide:
     - Deeper level of integration
     - Less network overhead

## When to Use This Pattern

### Suitable Scenarios

1. **Heterogeneous Applications**

   - Primary application uses different languages and frameworks
   - Component can be consumed by applications written in different languages

2. **Organizational Structure**

   - Component is owned by remote team or different organization

3. **Co-location Requirements**

   - Component/feature must be co-located on same host as application

4. **Independent Lifecycle Management**

   - Need service that shares overall lifecycle of main application
   - Requires ability to be independently updated

5. **Resource Control**
   - Need fine-grained control over resource limits for specific components
   - Want to restrict memory usage for specific components
   - Manage resource usage independently of main application

### Unsuitable Scenarios

1. **Performance-Critical Communication**

   - When inter-process communication needs optimization
   - Communication overhead and latency may be unacceptable for chatty interfaces

2. **Small Applications**

   - Resource cost of deploying sidecar service for each instance outweighs isolation benefits

3. **Different Scaling Requirements**
   - When service needs to scale differently or independently from main applications
   - Better to deploy as separate service in such cases

⚠️ **Important:** Consider tradeoffs against other pillar goals when implementing this pattern.

## Implementation Examples

### 1. Infrastructure API

**Scenario:** Infrastructure development team creates service deployed alongside each application

**Implementation:**

- Provides common layer for infrastructure services:
  - Logging
  - Environment data
  - Configuration store
  - Discovery
  - Health checks
  - Watchdog services
- Monitors parent application's host environment and process
- Logs information to centralized service

### 2. NGINX/HAProxy Management

**Implementation:**

- Deploy NGINX with sidecar service
- Sidecar monitors environment state
- Updates NGINX configuration file when state changes
- Recycles process when needed

### 3. Ambassador Sidecar

**Scenario:** Connectivity and communication management

**Implementation:**

- Deploy [Ambassador pattern](ambassador.md) service as sidecar
- Application calls through ambassador
- Handles:
  - Request logging
  - Routing
  - Circuit breaking
  - Other connectivity-related features

### 4. Offload Proxy

**Scenario:** Static content serving optimization

**Implementation:**

- Place NGINX proxy in front of Node.js service instance

- Reduce load on main application

## Related Patterns

- **[Ambassador Pattern](ambassador.md)** - Often implemented as a sidecar for handling external service communication

## Best Practices

1. **Communication Design**

   - Use lightweight, language-agnostic protocols (HTTP, gRPC)
   - Minimize communication frequency for performance
   - Implement proper error handling and timeouts

2. **Resource Management**

   - Set appropriate resource limits for sidecar containers
   - Monitor resource usage of both main app and sidecar
   - Consider resource sharing implications

3. **Lifecycle Management**

   - Ensure sidecar starts before or with main application
   - Implement proper shutdown procedures
   - Handle sidecar failures gracefully

4. **Security**

   - Apply principle of least privilege to sidecar
   - Secure inter-process communication
   - Regularly update sidecar components

5. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Monitor both application and sidecar health
   - Implement distributed tracing across components
   - Set up alerts for sidecar-specific issues

## Conclusion

The Sidecar pattern is a powerful architectural approach for extending application functionality while maintaining separation of concerns. It's particularly valuable in containerized environments and microservice architectures where you need to add cross-cutting capabilities without tightly coupling them to the main application logic.

**Key Takeaway:** Use sidecars when you need to add functionality that benefits from proximity to your application but should remain independently deployable and manageable.
