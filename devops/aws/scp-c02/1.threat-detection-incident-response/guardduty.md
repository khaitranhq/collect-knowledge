## Suppression Rules

- Set of criteria that automatically filter and archive new findings
- Example: low-value findings
- **Suppressed findings are NOT sent to Security Hub, S3, Detective, or EventBridge**
- Suppressed findings can be still viewed in the Archive

## Troubleshooting

### GuardDuty is activated but it didnâ€™t generate any DNS based findings?

- **Reason**: GuardDuty only processes DNS logs if you use the default VPC DNS resolver. All other types of DNS resolvers won't generated DNS based findings
