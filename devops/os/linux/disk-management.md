# Disk Manager

Keys to identify

- Volume
- Physical Volume
- Logical Volume
- Partition
- File system
- RAID

## Definitions

### Volume

A volume is a storage unit that represents a collection of data managed as a single entity. It can be a physical disk, a partition, or a logical volume created using LVM (Logical Volume Manager)

#### Physical volume

A Physical Volume (PV) is the lowest layer in the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) storage hierarchy. It represents actual storage devices (e.g., hard disks, SSDs, RAID arrays, or partitions) that can be added to Volume Groups (VGs) for flexible storage management.
Acts as a storage unit for Volume Groups (VGs) in LVM.
Can be a whole disk (e.g., /dev/sdb) or a partition (e.g., /dev/sdb1).
Allows dynamic resizing and flexible storage management

#### Logical volume

A Logical Volume (LV) is a virtual partition created within a Volume Group (VG) in Logical Volume Manager (LVM). Unlike traditional partitions, Logical Volumes offer flexibility, allowing you to resize, extend, or shrink them dynamically without unmounting the filesystem.

### Partition

A partition is a logically divided section of a physical storage device (e.g., hard disk, SSD) that acts as an independent unit for storing files and operating systems. It helps organize data, manage multiple operating systems, and optimize performance.
List partition details:

```
fdisk -l

### Partition vs Volume

Partition vs Volume: Key Differences
Feature Partition Volume
Definition A fixed-sized section of a physical disk. A logical storage unit that can span multiple disks.
Management Managed by traditional partitioning tools like fdisk, parted. Managed by Logical Volume Manager (LVM) or RAID.
Flexibility Static; resizing requires unmounting and sometimes data loss. Dynamic; can be resized, extended, or shrunk easily.
Spanning Disks Limited to a single disk. Can span multiple physical disks (LVM or RAID).
Usage Used for OS installation, boot partitions, and simple disk layouts. Used in enterprise setups where flexibility is needed.
File System Support Needs formatting (ext4, XFS, etc.). Can contain file systems but also supports snapshots, striping, and mirroring.
When to Use a Partition vs. a Volume?
✅ Use a Partition if:

You need a simple disk setup.
You don’t require dynamic resizing.
You are installing an OS and need a /boot or swap partition.
✅ Use a Volume if:

You want to resize, extend, or shrink storage dynamically.
You need disk spanning for larger storage pools.
You require snapshots, mirroring, or striping (LVM or RAID).

### File System

A file system is a method of organizing, storing, retrieving, and managing data on a storage device like a hard drive, SSD, or USB. It defines how files are named, structured, accessed, and stored on disk.

Types of File Systems in Linux
File System Description Pros Use Cases
ext4 (Fourth Extended File System) Default Linux file system, supports journaling. Fast, reliable, supports large files. Most Linux distributions.
XFS High-performance journaling file system. Scales well for large files. Enterprise storage, databases.
Btrfs (B-Tree File System) Advanced file system with snapshots and compression. Supports self-healing, RAID-like features. Modern Linux systems, backups.
ZFS High-performance file system with built-in RAID. Data integrity, snapshots, scalability. Enterprise servers, NAS.
FAT32 Legacy Windows-compatible file system. Works across all OS, simple. USB drives, small storage.
exFAT Modern FAT replacement for flash storage. No file size limits, cross-platform. Large USB drives, SD cards.
NTFS Windows default file system. Supports large files, journaling. Dual-boot with Windows.

### RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)

RAID is a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple physical disks into a single logical unit to improve performance, redundancy, or both. It is commonly used in servers and enterprise environments for fault tolerance and high availability.

### Logical Volume Manager

Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a storage management system used in Linux that provides a more flexible way to manage disk space compared to traditional partitioning methods. It allows you to create, resize, and manage logical volumes dynamically without needing to unmount filesystems or reboot the system.
